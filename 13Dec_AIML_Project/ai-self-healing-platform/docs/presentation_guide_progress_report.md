## ⚡ EMERGENCY BACKUP PLAN

**If demo fails**:
1. Say: "Let me show you screenshots of the working demo"
2. Have backup slides with screenshots
3. Walk through what would happen
4. Show code if needed
5. Maintain confidence!

**If running over time**:
- Skip Slide 5 (Technical)
- Go straight from Demo → Results → Thank You

**If running under time**:
- Add more detail in Slide 5
- Explain Phase 2 plans briefly

---

## 💡 SUCCESS TIPS

**Voice**:
- Speak clearly and confidently
- Slightly faster than normal (3 min is tight!)
- Emphasize numbers: "FORTY-TWO seconds", "NINETY-FOUR percent"

**Body Language**:
- Point at screen during demo
- Use hand gestures for emphasis
- Make eye contact with evaluators
- Smile!

**Technical**:
- Know exactly when to click vs when demo auto-runs
- Practice Alt+Tab switching until smooth
- Have mouse ready to point at dashboard elements

**Mindset**:
- You built something impressive!
- The demo WILL work (you've tested it)
- If something goes wrong, you have backups
- Evaluators want you to succeed
